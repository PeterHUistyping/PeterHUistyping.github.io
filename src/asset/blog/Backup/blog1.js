    <h2><strong>Environment Configuration
        </strong></h2>
    Using easyX https://easyx.cn/

    <h2>Requirement</h2>
    Draws a standard keyboard layout in the game window.<br/>

    <h2>Interface<br/></h2>
    The gamer presses a key in the keyboard when prompted, such as highlighting a key in the window above. Pressing the
    right one prompts the next letter, and pressing the wrong button, the program waits for the right one to be
    pressed.<br/>

    The key hints in the game should be a meaningful C program. For example, outputing hello world, solving Pi and so
    on.<br/>
    There should be an interface for the player to choose which program to practice.<br/>

    Regarding the game, it is designed to contain:<br/>
    Speed mode: The character falls from the sky, if you do not press the key in time, the character will fall to the
    ground, smashing a gap. When there are too much gaps, it is considered a failure.<br/>
    You can design a character with a reward, and pressing this one will automatically fill in some gaps.
    Scoring rules can be designed.<br/>
