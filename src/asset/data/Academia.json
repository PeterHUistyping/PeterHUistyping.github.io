        "Title": "May 2024 - Present",  
        "Journey": "I am privileged to undertake some interesting academic research explorations @[Core lab](https://core-lab.io/)  at the intersection of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. During this period, I explore the neural representations of materials, physical accuracy, generative models with evaluation, real-world material synthesis, and many other. <br/> <br/> Supported by [several grants and scholarships](https://peterhuistyping.github.io/#/award) from both my college and department, my undergraduate research is supervised by [Chenliang Zhou](https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/) on generative machine learning and Dr [Alejandro Sztrajman](https://asztr.github.io/) on real-world captured [BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function). Besides, I am mentored by Dr [Fangcheng Zhong](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fz261/) on Graphics (geometry representations and rendering), indoor layout synthesis, neural PDE solver."
