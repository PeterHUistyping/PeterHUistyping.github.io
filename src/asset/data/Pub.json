        "Journey": "Supervised by my supervisor <a href=\"https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/\">Chenliang Zhou</a>, I investigate the frequency information of materials, i.e. BRDF, and how to utilize it in the material fitting, reconstruction and editing.  The first task is derived from a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1703.06114\">set encoder</a> with the inductive biases of permutation invariance and input size flexibility. Then, we measure its capability in material linear interpolation editing. <br/> We observe that the naive NBRDF autoencoder pipeline described above lacks the frequency information between the two NBRDFs, which might aid NBRDF weight distribution learning. I propose different methods to decompose BRDF three-dimensional inputs into those in unit sphere. Spherical harmonics is leveraged to express per-channel BRDF as a linear combination of orthonormal base functions, which captures the frequency information of BRDF.  <br/> This framework enhances fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreNBRDF improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications."

Our methods support the unconditional, statistically constrained and multi-modal generation of materials. With my experiments on PCA, VAE taking in either original or neural materials, we found out that hyperdiffusion has superiority in generating materials with high fidelity and diversity. <br/> Team up with Dr <a href=\"https://asztr.github.io/\">Alejandro Sztrajman</a>, we further explore and finalize the statistical constraints for each type of material, e.g. plastic, fabric, metallic, mirror-like, etc, based on observation and experiments. It serves as a classical, as well as ML-free way to classify the material. <br/> In particular, there is a lack of effective BRDF-space metrics in generation tasks, where we fill the gap through my experiments, targeting the diversity and fidelity with various underlying distance functions tried. Through literature review, I raise the idea of adapting point cloud based metrics to the field of materials. With further discussions with <a href=\"https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/\">Chenliang Zhou</a>, we finalize on which pairwise distance measurements to use. To further illustrate its effectiveness, I utilize the confusion matrix to demonstrate the evaluation process. With help of my plotted graph, it's clear that our methods are able to identify the relationship between reference and synthetic material sets. <br/> Finally, as a proof of concept, I setup some typical scenes using the proposed materials and render them with the physically-based renderer <a href=\"http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/\">Mitsuba3</a>, which I writeup the BSDF class taking in the required binary format with proper importance sampling strategies (since there's no such public error-free implementation for Python version Mitsuba3).<br/> "

Meanwhile, I investigated the YOLO-v8 Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) <a href=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/15805\">detection error</a> and proposed alternative methods, e.g. Rotated Bounding Box (RBB).<br/> The former <a href=\"https://tangjiapeng.github.io/projects/DiffuScene/\">DiffuScene</a> is based on applying diffusion model for parametrized objects (location, size, orientation, class, shape code). For greater instruction control, the latter <a href=\"https://chenguolin.github.io/projects/InstructScene/\"> InstructScene</a> follows a two-stage procedure. A semantic graph, with class label, (additional) pairwise spatial relationship and quantized features, is constructed from the prior semantic input. After that, a separate 3D decoder determines the exact layout (location, size, orientation).
