        Strong background and interest in Math, Algorithms and System related fields. <br/>
        
        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Conducted long-term System-related (Graphics/GPU, CPU, etc) research with AI/ML in industry lab</b>, ranging from high-level architecture/algorithm design to low-level implementation. Theoretical expertise (literature, brainstorm), coupled with practical skills (the key developer for the simulation framework), comprise my areas of research proficiency. <br/>

        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Enjoy most of the elegant and crazy ideas raised in Computer Science</b>, mathematic principles as well as engineering techniques. It includes courses from Cambridge, MIT/CMU OpenCourseWare.   <br/>

        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Past group competition experience in compression</b> implemented in C and C++, where new ideas on LZSS and complete pipeline come up from our team. It achieves a lossless compression with overall better compression rate and processing speed compared with google Draco for the given 3D graphics data input. <br/>

        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Exploring areas in Computer System, Graphic and Machine Learning-Data Science, etc and open to new opportunities and fields.       <br/>
