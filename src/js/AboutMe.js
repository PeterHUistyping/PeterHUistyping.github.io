        - System-related (Scheduling, CPU), <br/>

        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        ranging from high-level architecture design to low-level algorithm implementation. 
        Theoretical expertise (literature, brainstorm), coupled with practical skills (the key developer for the simulation framework), comprise my areas of research proficiency. <br/>


        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Enjoy most of the elegant and crazy ideas raised in Computer Science</b>, mathematic principles as well as engineering techniques. It includes courses from Cambridge, MIT/CMU OpenCourseWare.   <br/>


        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Past group competition experience in compression</b> implemented in C and C++, where new ideas on LZSS and complete pipeline come up from our team. It achieves a lossless compression with overall better compression rate and processing speed compared with google Draco for the given 3D graphics data input. <br/>


        &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Exploring areas in Graphics + AI/ML with GPU, CV / System-related topics, etc and open to new opportunities and fields.       <br/>
