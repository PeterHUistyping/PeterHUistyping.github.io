        <br/>
        I am privileged to undertake some interesting academic research explorations @<a href="https://core-lab.io/">Core Lab</a> at the intersection of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. During this period, I explore the neural representations of materials, physical accuracy, real-world material synthesis, evaluation of generation models and many other. <br/>
                
        My undergraduate research is supervised by <a href="https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/">Chenliang Zhou</a> on generative machine learning and Dr. <a href="https://asztr.github.io/">Alejandro Sztrajman</a> on real-world materials and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function">Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)</a>; mentored by
        Dr. <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fz261/">Fangcheng Zhou</a> on Graphics (geometry representations and rendering).<br/> <br/>
        
        <p><b>ABOUT my first paper</b> <i>NeuMaDiff: Neural Material Synthesis via Hyperdiffusion</i> ... </p>
        Coauthored with my supervisors <a href="https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/">Chenliang Zhou</a> and Dr. <a href="https://asztr.github.io/">Alejandro Sztrajman</a>, we together propose different aspects to the novel architecture, where I draw the network architecture via LaTeX <a href="https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf">TikZ</a>. Our methods support the unconditional, statistically constrained and multi-modal generation of materials. With my experiments on PCA, VAE taking in either original or neural materials, we found out that hyperdiffusion has superiority in generating materials with high fidelity and diversity. <br/>
        Team up with Dr. <a href="https://asztr.github.io/">Alejandro Sztrajman</a>, we further explore and finalize the statistical constraints for each type of material, e.g. plastic, fabric, metallic, mirror-like, etc, based on observation and experiments. It serves as a classical, as well as ML-free way to classify the material. <br/>
        In particular, there is a lack of effective BRDF-space metrics in generation tasks, where we fill the gap through my experiments, targeting the diversity and fidelity with various underlying distance functions tried. Through literature review, I raise the idea of adapting point cloud based metrics to the field of materials. With further discussions with <a href="https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/">Chenliang Zhou</a>, we finalize on which pairwise distance measurements to use. To further illustrate its effectiveness, I utilize the confusion matrix to demonstrate the evaluation process. With help of my plotted graph, it's clear that our methods are able to identify the relationship between reference and synthetic material sets. <br/>
        Finally, as a proof of concept, I setup some typical scenes using the proposed materials and render them with the physically-based renderer <a href="http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba3</a>, which I writeup the BSDF class taking in the required binary format with proper importance sampling strategies (since there's no such public error-free implementation for Python version Mitsuba3).<br/>
