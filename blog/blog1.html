<h1>Typing-Game</h1>
C Project Super Programmer Game Development<br> <a href="https://github.com/PeterHUistyping/Typing-Game">Project
    (Github) </a>

<h2><strong>Environment Configuration
    </strong></h2>
Using easyX https://easyx.cn/

<h2>Requirement</h2>
Draws a standard keyboard layout in the game window.<br>

<h2>Interface<br></h2>
The gamer presses a key in the keyboard when prompted, such as highlighting a key in the window above. Pressing the
right one prompts the next letter, and pressing the wrong button, the program waits for the right one to be pressed.<br>

The key hints in the game should be a meaningful C program. For example, outputing hello world, solving Pi and so
on.<br>
There should be an interface for the player to choose which program to practice.<br>

Regarding the game, it is designed to contain:<br>
Speed mode: The character falls from the sky, if you do not press the key in time, the character will fall to the
ground, smashing a gap. When there are too much gaps, it is considered a failure.<br>
You can design a character with a reward, and pressing this one will automatically fill in some gaps.
Scoring rules can be designed.<br>
