MIT6.837 CG Fall2004 Assignment

## About this Assignment

With the help of the Open Course, I have the experience of writing a ray tracer using C++, including ray casting, normal visualization, rendering, voxel rendering, supersampling and 3D OpenGL visualization. It is also a part of MIT6.837 assignment.   
Throughout the process, I implement two kinds of cameras, orthonormal and perspective camera respectively. In addition, several types of primitive objectives are built, e.g. sphere, triangle, plane, triangle mesh, just to name a few. On top of that, Composite design pattern is used for creating 3D objects hierarchy with transformation. Several Light effect is implemented.   
Even though there is plenty of obstacle finishing the task (like the use of depreciated GLUT library), lots of interesting things are learnt.  
Folder .vscode(i.e., settings.json, launch.json, tasks,json and c_cpp_properties.json) helps build and compile the C++ program. What's special is that it also keeps Vscode occupying tiny amount of space on PC compared with other IDE. Command-line could help build the project efficiently.

*scene1_07.txt sample output is wrong* \
（Use scene1_08.txt，camera center 0,0,2 instead）\
Proved by linking two sphere functions, which turn out to be an oval on plane XOY.

Guidance:
*Within the real-time interface*\
 Calling the render function by pressing 'r'.\
 The application can be terminated by pressing 'q' or calling exit().*

*Adjustment
Some head files in ray folder is being cut to Object3D folder.\
Codes have been revised.

Command Line Argument: in/... out/...\
Set the vertex normal before specifying each vertex position\
Blinn-Phong Model the exponent->100 (nonlinear relationship)

#### Assignment4: [Ray Tracer]

    Shadows Reflection & Refraction
    OpenGL API Representation
    PointLight

A glimpse of it ⬇

![Ray Tracer BUG](/asset/photo/Assignment/blog3/MyProject/assignment4_Ray-Tracer/RayTracerBUG.png)
 
*Adjustment
Tessellation args can be controlled by Command Line Arguments.
On Main.C 
    a new pointer to SceneParser -> no need for function arg 
                                 -> openGL rendering enabled. (camera adjusted)
On raytrace.h  
    main loop raycasting has been transferred here.

#### Assignment5: [Voxel Rendering]

    Bounding boxes for Primitives
    Sphere voxelization
    Regular grid data structure
    Grid::paint()-Two Ways to previsualize
    Fast ray-grid intersection
    Transformation:Flatten the Transformation Hierarchy

Updated: extern.h

Using Ray-Box Intersection From Ray Casting II

Guidance: a single ray is traced by pressing the 't' key. \
Then the 'g' key will toggle between\ 
    (1) visualizing all occupied grid cells
    (2) visualizing the cells traversed while walking along the ray
    & (3) the faces crossed to enter each cell along the ray.

#### Assignment6: [Grid Acceleration & Solid Textures]
    
    RAY TRACING STATISTICS  
    Grid Acceleration   
    Solid Textures  
    CheckerBoard, Perlin Noise, Wood, etc  

A glimpse of it ⬇  

![Texture](/asset/photo/Assignment/blog3/MyProject/assignment6_Grid-Acceleration+Solid-Textures/Texture.png)

Tips: All related line-arguments should be declared  
(No longer in Assignment 7 Fixed by removing ~ delete m on Grid and Object3D class)  
*Adjustment:
    delete box;  //no []
    pixel->width, height

#### Assignment7: [Supersampling & Antialiasing]
    
    Several new base and derived Class  
    Class Film, Sample  
    Class Sampler: - random/uniform/jittered samples  
    Class Filter: -box/tent/gaussian filter  
    Reference: Fundamentals of computer graphics-(2009)  Ch9 SignalProcessing

![Antialiasing](MyProject/assignment7_Supersampling+Antialiasing/Antialiasing.png)

*Adjustment:  
    Revise use of grid and visualize_grid  
    Tips: All related line-arguments should be declared  
(No longer in Assignment 7 Fixed by removing ~ delete m on Grid and Object3D class)  

#### Assignment8: [Curves & Surfaces]
    
     A NEW Chapter
    
## Setup the MyProject
*Notice that .C = .cpp (at least in VScode)

From Assignment3 onwards, include the below header Files on Mac instead.
    
    #define GL_SILENCE_DEPRECATION
    // Defined before OpenGL and GLUT includes to avoid deprecation messages 
    #include <OpenGL/gl.h> 
    #include <OpenGL/glu.h> 
    #include <GLUT/glut.h> 

    In task.json
        "-framework" ,"GLUT"," -framework", "OpenGL"

    Add glutInit(&argc, argv); in main
        change glEnable() etc after glutCreateWindow("OpenGL Viewer");

    *Adjustment
    In addition, some head files in ray folder is being cut to Object3D folder.\
    Codes have been revised.

### Using VSCode C++ 
Using my code (on Mac Clang++)\
Note that you should open the Myproject folder,\
/lib contains vector-matrix-image header files or .C\
/ray contains the other.

You should replace four files in .vscode (in Myproject folder) with those from each corresponding .vscode-assignment*(0-9) (in assignment folder).\
.vscode-assignment*(0-9) is used for coding via the Myproject folder.

*In assignment 0, there are two ".vscode" folders\
.vscode-assignment0 is used for coding via the Myproject folder.\
.vscode-inside is used for coding via the assignment0_Barnsley fern folder. \
DO NEED to include everything from lib folder.

### Using Viusal Studio
Try doing it yourself.
