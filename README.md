## Trouble Shooting
```
You attempted to import d.json which falls outside of the project src/ directory. 
Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported.
You can either move it inside src/, or add a symlink to it from project's node_modules/.
```
Solution:
node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js
```
plugins: [
// Prevents users from importing files from outside of src/ (or node_modules/).
// This often causes confusion because we only process files within src/ with babel.
// To fix this, we prevent you from importing files out of src/ -- if you'd like to,
// please link the files into your node_modules/ and let module-resolution kick in.
// Make sure your source files are compiled, as they will not be processed in any way.
// new ModuleScopePlugin(paths.appSrc, [
//   paths.appPackageJson,
//   reactRefreshRuntimeEntry,
//   reactRefreshWebpackPluginRuntimeEntry,
//   babelRuntimeEntry,
//   babelRuntimeEntryHelpers,
//   babelRuntimeRegenerator,
// ]),
 ```

 ```
 Can't resolve '../.png' in '/src/js'
 ```
 Solution:
 Same file
 ```
 include: paths.appSrc,
 ->
 include: [paths.appSrc,"./public/asset"],
 ```
