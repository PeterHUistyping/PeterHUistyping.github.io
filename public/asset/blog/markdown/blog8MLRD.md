* Sentiment Classification (NLP)
* Hidden States Prediction (Hidden Markov Model)

## Dependency
NLTK-Natural Language Toolkit
IDE: PyCharm
## Sentiment Lexicon Database
Given a list of tokens from a tokenized review and a lexicon containing both sentiment and magnitude of a word, determine whether the sentiment of each review in the test set is positive or negative based on whether there are more positive or negative words.\
Classification: label Lexicons into postive and negative.\
Evaluation: Based on reviews on IMDb. \
Improve the classifier using thresholds for decision bounds.
```
Your accuracy: 0.6355555555555555
Your improved accuracy: 0.6888888888888889
```
## Naive Bayes Classifier
Parameter estimation\
How to deal with a word in a review was not present in the training dataset?\ 
Ignore its contribution or using add-one (Laplace) Smoothing 
```
Your accuracy using simple classifier: 0.63
Your accuracy using unsmoothed probabilities: 0.49
Your accuracy using smoothed probabilities: 0.795

## Zipf’s Law and Heaps’ Law
Zipf’s law says that there is a reverse exponential relationship between the frequency of a word (fw) in a large natural language text, and its relative frequency rank (rw; the ranking of its frequency in comparison with other words’ frequencies) \

Heaps’ law relates the number of distinct words in a text to the overall number of words in the text.

## Statistical Significance Testing
Modify the simple classifier to include the information about the magnitude of a sentiment.\
A word with a strong intensity should be weighted *four* times as high for the evaluator.\
Implement the two-sided sign test algorithm to determine if one classifier is significantly better or worse than     another. The sign for a result should be determined by which classifier is more correct and the ceiling of the least common sign total should be used to calculate the probability.
```
The p-value of the two-sided sign test for classifier_a "classifier simple" and classifier_b "classifier magnitude": 0.6722499772048186
The p-value of the two-sided sign test for classifier_a "classifier magnitude" and classifier_b "naive bayes classifier": 0.07683763213126037
```

## Cross-Validation and Evaluation Sets
### Training and Evaluation Sets
1. Random: Assign the data points to folds randomly. 
2. Stratified random: Assign the data points to folds randomly but make sure that there is the same number of positive and negative reviews in each fold.

0. Train an HMM model with the available labelled training data as done in the first part of the task.
1. Use the trained model to predict the hidden sequences of all available unlabelled data.
2. Merge the labelled data with the new pseudo-labelled data.
3. Train a new HMM model on the merged data. 
4. Repeat Step 1 (for the now pseudo-labelled data) to 3 for a total of t iterations.
