**Appendix: Heuristic Evaluation of the Design**

1. Visibility of system statusDesigns should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate, timely feedback.use progress bars / indicators
2. Match between system and real worldThe design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.
3. User control and freedomUsers often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action.
4. Consistency and standardsUsers should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
5. Error preventionGood error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.
6. Recognition rather than recallMinimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. Avoid making users remember information.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of useShortcuts - hidden from novice users - may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist designInterfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information.
9. Help users recognize and recover from errorsError messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
10. Help and documentation
    It‚Äôs best if the design doesn‚Äôt need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users complete their tasks.
